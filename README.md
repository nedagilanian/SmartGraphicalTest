# SmartGraphicalTest
This project involves auditing, identifying, and fixing security vulnerabilities in a smart contract. The focus is on detecting logical flaws, access control issues, and potential exploits that could lead to unauthorized token transfers or contract manipulation. The improvements include security patches, gas optimization, and enhanced access control mechanisms.
